  abstract  = "Glioblastoma is one of the most treatment-resistant and lethal
               cancers, with a subset of self-renewing brain tumour stem cells
               (BTSCs), driving therapy resistance and relapse. Here, we report
               that mubritinib effectively impairs BTSC stemness and growth.
               Mechanistically, bioenergetic assays and rescue experiments
               showed that mubritinib targets complex I of the electron
               transport chain, thereby impairing BTSC self-renewal and
               proliferation. Gene expression profiling and Western blot
               analysis revealed that mubritinib disrupts the AMPK/p27Kip1
               pathway, leading to cell-cycle impairment. By employing in vivo
               pharmacokinetic assays, we established that mubritinib crosses
               the blood-brain barrier. Using preclinical patient-derived and
               syngeneic models, we demonstrated that mubritinib delays
               glioblastoma progression and extends animal survival. Moreover,
               combining mubritinib with radiotherapy or chemotherapy offers
               survival advantage to animals. Notably, we showed that
               mubritinib alleviates hypoxia, thereby enhancing ROS generation,
               DNA damage, and apoptosis in tumours when combined with
               radiotherapy. Encouragingly, toxicological and behavioural
               studies revealed that mubritinib is well tolerated and spares
               normal cells. Our findings underscore the promising therapeutic
               potential of mubritinib, warranting its further exploration in
               clinic for glioblastoma therapy.",
